"""This modules deals with the daunting task of generating geometries"""

# TODO: Implement this module
# - Probably better in its own directory:
#   - One file for nanotubes
#   - one file for surfaces
#   - one file for crystals (including defects)
#   - one file for laminar materials
#   - one file for molecules and conformers
