# TrainCraft — Roadmap

Phased, sequenced delivery. The **dataset + selection layer is the spine**:
geometry and the active-learning loop both build on it.

See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the target architecture.

---

## ✅ Phase 0 — Foundation + vertical slice  *(done, `d43d3b8`)*

**Goal:** a clean, installable, testable package with no globals and no `chdir`,
plus a thin end-to-end walking skeleton proving the architecture.

Delivered
- Correct package (`__init__.py`, relative imports, `pip install -e .`, console
  script), pixi env config (`pyproject.toml [tool.pixi.workspace]`), ruff +
  pytest config, GitHub Actions CI.
- `config/` — pydantic v2 models (discriminated unions, `extra=forbid`) + TOML
  loader. **No import-time singleton.** One TOML still drives the whole workflow.
- `core/` — `Structure` (+hash), `registry`, `Workspace`/`Job` (no `os.chdir`),
  `Result`, `provenance`, seeded RNG.
- `geometry/` — Source×Builder×Transform (file/scratch sources; nanotube/molecule
  builders; vacuum/supercell/perturb transforms).
- `calculators/potentials.py` — `emt` (force field), `tblite`/`xtb`
  (semiempirical), `mace` (MLIP). ANI/NEP dropped. MACE plumbing fixed.
- `sampling/` — `md` (Langevin NVT) and `rattle` (HiPhive) ported; molecule-aware
  `monte_carlo` interface stubbed.
- `selection/` — funnel: `physicality` → `dedup` → `diversity` (FPS) → `budget`.
- `datasets/` — extxyz IO with provenance; `Dataset` (hash-dedup + origin filter).
- `orchestration/local.py` — `run_pipeline` serial engine.
- `cli.py` — `run` / `validate` / `new` / `plugins`.
- `examples/` — 6 annotated examples covering different builders, samplers,
  selection configs, and calculators.
- 19 tests pass, ruff clean, CLI verified end-to-end.

## Phase 1 — Geometry breadth  *(next)*

**Goal:** generate all the system types that matter scientifically. Delivered in
chunks so each is independently testable and reviewable.

### ✅ Chunk 1 — Molecules-on-surfaces + Monte Carlo  *(done)*

Full implementation spec: [`docs/phase1_chunk1_spec.md`](docs/phase1_chunk1_spec.md).
Designs the hard abstraction (**fragment identity**, per-atom `tc_fragment` array +
runtime `infer_fragments` for reactive runs) first, plus the features that depend
on it:
- `core/fragments.py` — fragment-identity layer (the spine of this chunk).
- Source: `smiles` (RDKit ETKDG + optimize).
- Builders: `surface_adsorbate` (single adsorbate, `ase.build.add_adsorbate`,
  zero deps) and `surface_packing` (N-molecule coverage via the Packmol binary).
- `sampling/monte_carlo.py` — Metropolis MC with rigid-body translate/rotate +
  RDKit conformer-swap moves; optional `refresh_fragments` for bond-changing runs.

### ✅ Chunk 2 — Mechanical geometry breadth  *(done)*

Unblocked by the fragment abstraction from Chunk 1:
- `core/converter.py` — ASE ↔ pymatgen ↔ RDKit bridge (periodic→`Structure`,
  molecular→`Molecule`; RDKit bond perception via `DetermineBonds`). Wired into
  `Structure.to_/from_pymatgen` and `.to_/from_rdkit`.
- Source: `url` (download → ASE read; `file://` works for local/offline use).
- Builders: `crystal` (bulk via `ase.build.bulk` + supercell + vacancy/
  substitution/interstitial defects with stable indexing); `slab` (standalone
  surface — named facet *or* Miller indices cleaved from bulk; bare slab is all
  framework); `layered` (graphene/hBN/MX2 stacking with interlayer spacing,
  AA/AB Bernal stacking, and twist — twisted stacks return a non-periodic moiré
  flake to avoid incommensurate-cell artefacts).
- Transforms: `strain` (hydrostatic or Voigt; scales atoms with the cell),
  `rotate` (named axis or vector, optional cell rotation), `set_pbc`.

Acceptance (met)
- Each builder/transform produces a valid `Structure` with correct pbc/cell and
  provenance; full unit coverage (`test_converter`, `test_crystal_builder`,
  `test_slab_builder`, `test_layered_builder`, `test_transforms`,
  `test_url_source`).
- `examples/12_bulk_vacancy_md.toml`, `13_slab_strain_md.toml`, and
  `14_graphene_bilayer_md.toml` run end-to-end (zero extra deps).

### ✅ Chunk 3 — Database providers + liquids + intercalation + constraints  *(done)*

- Sources: `materials_project` (mp-api + pymatgen), `optimade` (dependency-free
  JSON parse against any provider base URL), `pubchem` (dependency-free 3D SDF
  via PUG REST).
- Builders: `liquid` (Packmol multi-species box; explicit cell *or* density-driven
  cubic box; per-molecule fragment tagging) and `intercalation` (guests on an
  in-plane grid in each gallery of a planar layered host, with electrochemical
  `stage` control and `gallery_expansion`).
- Transforms: `constraints` (`FixAtoms` by indices / elements / `tc_fragment` /
  `below_z`, OR-ed). Selects on the *final* structure — the correct place to
  (re)apply constraints after a reordering builder (Packmol), fixing the legacy
  index-misalignment bug.

Acceptance (met)
- Each builder/source/transform yields a valid `Structure` with correct
  pbc/cell and provenance; unit coverage in `test_constraints`,
  `test_intercalation_builder`, `test_liquid_builder`, `test_providers`
  (network/Packmol paths skip cleanly when deps are absent).
- `examples/15_h_graphite_intercalation.toml` and `16_slab_constraints_md.toml`
  run end-to-end (zero deps); `17_water_box_liquid.toml` runs in the science env.

### Remaining Phase-1 item

- Builder: `polymer` (PySoftK). Deferred — the PySoftK dependency is not reliably
  resolvable (see `pyproject.toml`) and the wrapper must be verified against the
  live PySoftK API before shipping rather than guessed.

## Phase 2 — DFT labeling with full property set

**Goal:** label E/F/stress + dipole + polarizability. **Production target is
FHI-aims on CINECA Leonardo** (see "Packaging & HPC deployment" below).

Deliverables
- `calculators/dft.py` — QE and FHI-AIMS factories; SCF for E/F/stress; dipole
  output; **polarizability via DFPT** (AIMS `DFPT dielectric`; QE `ph.x`).
  FHI-aims is an ASE `FileIOCalculator`; its run command is **injected from the
  environment** (`TRAINCRAFT_AIMS_COMMAND`, default `aims.x`) so the plugin stays
  container-agnostic (DESIGN §20.3).
- Labeled results written to extxyz with level-of-theory provenance.
- Cost-aware labeling (polarizability flagged as the expensive task; selection
  accounts for the cost).
- `runs/<name>/labeled_dft/` tree + `manifest.json` (level-of-theory, counts).

Acceptance
- A selected frame is labeled with all requested properties and lands in
  `labeled_dft/` with provenance; QE and AIMS paths verified on a tiny system.
- FHI-aims path verified end-to-end inside `traincraft-dft.sif` (a tiny molecule,
  single node) before scaling.

## Cross-cutting — Packaging & HPC deployment (Leonardo)

**Goal:** run the real workflow on CINECA Leonardo via Apptainer. Gates Phase 2
(DFT labeling) and Phase 3 (MACE training at scale). Full architecture in
[`DESIGN.md` §20](DESIGN.md).

Three images, dispatched as Slurm steps by the `core` orchestrator:
- `traincraft-core.sif` (CPU) — package + geometry/selection/datasets/orchestration.
- `traincraft-mlip.sif` (GPU/Booster) — PyTorch + CUDA + MACE; sampling + training.
- `traincraft-dft.sif` (CPU/DCGP) — **FHI-aims** (MPI/MKL/ScaLAPACK); private build.

Deliverables
- `containers/` — three Apptainer `*.def` files + README (build via fakeroot /
  off-cluster, then transfer the `.sif`; FHI-aims license/source kept out of the repo).
- `orchestration/` executor config: per-stage `(image, partition, resources,
  gpu?, mpi?)`; renders `srun [--nv] apptainer exec --bind … <image> <cmd>`.
- Command-injection plumbing so `dft.py`/`mace` are container-agnostic.
- FHI-aims hybrid-MPI binding (host MPI/libfabric/UCX) verified multi-node.

Acceptance
- `core` builds geometry and dispatches a GPU sampling step (`mlip.sif`) and a
  multi-node FHI-aims label step (`dft.sif`) on Leonardo; results land in the
  dataset with provenance, identical in shape to a local `emt` run.

---

## Phase 3 — Training + validation (multi-head MACE)

**Goal:** train MACE on all properties and measure quality end-to-end.

Deliverables
- `training/` — MACE fine-tune/train wrapper (`mace_run_train --foundation_model`),
  explicit multi-head config (energy/forces + optional dipole + polarizability),
  checkpoints, metrics. Pluggable model interface for future backends.
- `datasets/` health tooling: composition/space/volume coverage maps; energy and
  per-element force distributions with outlier flags; extrapolation grade;
  redundancy report.
- `validation/` — per-property parity + RMSE/MAE (per element), learning curves,
  NVE/MD stability, EOS/phonons, **IR and Raman spectra reconstruction** from
  MLIP-driven MD vs DFT/experiment.

Acceptance
- A fine-tuned model trains on a seed set and produces a quality report covering
  every property, including reconstructed IR/Raman spectra.

---

## Phase 4 — Active-learning loop

**Goal:** close the loop to convergence automatically.

Deliverables
- `selection/uncertainty.py` — committee/ensemble uncertainty selector (plugs into
  the existing funnel).
- `active_learning/` — explore → select → label → retrain → converge; thresholds
  drawn from `validation` (val force-RMSE, spectral error); resume/idempotency
  across iterations.

Acceptance
- Starting from a seed set, the loop runs ≥2 iterations unattended; the dataset
  grows only with informative + diverse frames; validation error decreases.

---

## Phase 5 — Orchestration

**Goal:** parallelism without touching the science.

Deliverables
- `orchestration/` — `local` engine hardened (threadpool for independent jobs);
  QuACC adapter expressing the AL loop as a DAG with parallel explore/label fan-out.
  Engine chosen by simplicity after the core is proven.

Acceptance
- The same AL workflow runs under `local` and the chosen engine with identical
  results; explore and label stages fan out in parallel.

---

## Phase 6 — Polish & extras

- Full public API docs + library-usage tutorials (including the Raman use case).
- Additional MLIP backends (MatterSim/Orb/SevenNet/CHGNet) via the model registry.
- Deferred, architecture-friendly: **node-based workflow editor** emitting the
  serialized TOML DAG.
